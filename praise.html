Hi guys,
Thought I’d share with you some unsolicited positive feedback relating to our web that popped up on Twitter last Friday.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best Australian mobile website I’ve used, so far <a href="https://twitter.com/latrobe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@latrobe</a> bravo <a href="https://t.co/H6dbiJALF3">https://t.co/H6dbiJALF3</a></p>&mdash; Madonna Deverson (@madnyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/madnyc/status/931418800380985345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

I just wanted to forward on some feedback from a student that attended our Advisory Event yesterday.

I met a boy by the name of Byron who had travelled from Sydney because he is super keen on studying Event Management and Marketing at La Trobe.  La Trobe popped up on his radar for two reasons….one – the Aspire program and two….our amazing website.

He said it was the best website out of any university he has seen and commended us on the usability of our website.

He even borrowed an iPad to show me other universities webpages and why they aren’t functional. 

I wanted to make sure that this was passed onto you both and your relevant teams – it’s always fantastic to hear these things first handJ

Great job!

Warm regards,
Lorraine Ryan

Hi Lisa
 
I wanted to let you know that I managed to have one of our web developers look at the template Stuart has created and his feedback is that it is perfect!  I have NEVER had a perfect template sent to me as a first attempt so please pass on my praise to Stuart!
 
Obviously, we will need to add the PageUp People links to the left side menu once these have been finalised so there will be some changes required later down the track, but the actual structure and code behind the link is fantastic!  I have everything I need to get the development started on your website which is great news.
 
Cheers
Bec

I have been playing with the website on and off all morning and I LOVE THE LOOK AND FEEL. Firstly the colours – in your face (in a good way), so easy to read and navigate and it’s friendly both in usability as well as its style. I have also been playing around on my iPhone and boy is this a different look and feel to other uni’s!

I have lived through quite a few “new” looks at other institutions over the years and this is by far a standout.

Could you please pass on my congratulations to the team behind this.

Thank you….thank you….thank you!!! To you and all who obviously worked very hard on the new web design. My greatest joy is that our HDR students know who they are and where they belong in two clicks of the mouse!!! It has been such a journey for them, I know they will be appreciative.

I’m sure in the coming days, as we all become accustomed to the new lay out there will be challenges and possible tweaking needed…but what a fantastic beginning!!!! It will only get better and better I am sure.

Please pass my congratulations on to all involved.

Hi Stuart,
 
Thanks for all your work on the LTU Times site, it looks fantastic and we are very happy!
 
We apologize for not going live before Easter but the site needed to be checked. I have attached a spreadsheet of a few minor changes that we would like made. Can you please let us know if these are all ok and when you think you may be able to have them done. Then we are ready to go live.
 
Please call and discuss if you need any clarification
